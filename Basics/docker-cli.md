# 01 Basics - Docker CLI Essentials

## Introduction

Docker provides a powerful command-line interface (CLI) to interact with containers, images, networks, and volumes. Here are the essential commands to get started.

---

## System Information

- Check Docker version:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

- Show Docker system info:
  ```bash
  docker info
  ```

- List all Docker commands:

  docker help
  ```

---

## Working with Images

  docker images
  ```

- Pull an image from Docker Hub:
  ```bash

## Working with Containers

  ```

---

## Inspect & Logs

## Executing Commands Inside a Container

- Interactive shell into a running container:
